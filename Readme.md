Tiddloid Lite, a lightweight version of [Tiddloid](https://github.com/donmor/Tiddloid), is an app to work with locally stored TiddlyWikis. Once have some ideas, you can immediately write them down and save it in a tiddler, and sync the Wiki to your other devices so that you can access these ideas anywhere.
